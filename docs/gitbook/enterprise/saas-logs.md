# SaaS Logs

Panther Enterprise supports pulling logs directly from SaaS platforms such as Okta, OneLogin, and more.

The two mechanisms used are direct integrations (by querying APIs) and AWS EventBridge.

## Direct

Supported direct SaaS integrations include:
* Okta
* G Suite
* Box
* More coming soon!

To set up, head to `Log Analysis` > `Sources` > `ADD SOURCE`, and select one of the integrations listed.
