# Panther Enterprise

In addition to the open-source community edition, Panther offers an enterprise product with all
community features plus:

* 24x7 Live Support
* [Role-Based Access Control](rbac.md)
* Premium rule and policy packs, including PCI and AWS+

and many more features coming soon! Panther Enterprise can be deployed in your own AWS account or
managed by Panther in our single-tenant hosted environment.
See our [pricing](https://runpanther.io/pricing/) page for more information.

## Upgrading from Community
An existing deployment of the community edition can be upgraded in-place to enterprise with no
loss of data nor extra configuration required. The [deploy process](../quick-start.md) is the same.
