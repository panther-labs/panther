In addition to the open-source community edition, Panther offers an enterprise product with all
community features plus:

* [Data Explorer](data-explorer.md)
* Premium Analysis Packs for PCI and AWS+
* Customer Support with SLAs

and many more features coming soon!

Panther Enterprise can be deployed in your own AWS account or managed by Panther in our single-tenant
hosted environment.

## Upgrading from Community
An existing deployment of the community edition can be upgraded in-place to enterprise with no
loss of data nor extra configuration required. The [deploy process](../quick-start.md) is the same.
