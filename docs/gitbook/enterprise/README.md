# Panther Enterprise

Panther offers an enterprise-ready product with all of the community features, plus:

* [Data Explorer](data-analytics/data-explorer.md) to search collected data
* [SaaS Log Pulling](saas-logs.md)
* [Data Compaction](data-analytics/log-compaction.md) for faster queries
* [Role-Based Access Control](rbac.md)
* [SAML/SSO Support](saml/overview.md)
* Customer Support SLAs
* And more! 

Panther Enterprise can be deployed in your own AWS account (Cloud-Prem) or managed by Panther (Cloud) in our single-tenant hosted environment.

## Upgrading from Community

An existing Panther deployment can be upgraded in-place to Enterprise with no data loss or extra configuration required. The [deploy process](../quick-start.md) is the same.
