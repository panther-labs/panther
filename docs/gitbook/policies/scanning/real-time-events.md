# Real-Time Events

To monitor all AWS resource changes in real-time, Panther utilizes CloudWatch Events.

## Prerequisites

To configure real-time events to Panther from multiple regions and accounts, we can use [AWS CloudFormation StackSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html). The following diagram illustrates this with an example model:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/stack_set_conceptual_sv.png)

### Plan Your Account Layout

Determine which AWS account will act as the `Administrator` account that manages stack creation and updates.

Then determine the list of AWS accounts that will act as `Target` accounts that send logs to Panther.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `Administrator` account may also be the `Target` account. To run and scan a single AWS account, this will always be the case, and both IAM roles are required.
{% endhint %}

### Setup Administrator Account

The Administrator account must have a StackSet IAM Admin Role, which grants permissions to manage stacks in multiple accounts. Log into the `Administrator` AWS account and click [here](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/panther-public-cloudformation-templates/panther-stackset-iam-admin-role/latest/template.yml&stackName=panther-stackset-iam-admin-role) to launch this stack in CloudFormation.

Alternatively, go to the CloudFormation console to create a new stack, with the following templateÂ URL:

`https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/panther-public-cloudformation-templates/panther-stackset-iam-admin-role/latest/template.yml`

This Role only has permissions to assume an IAM Role called `StackSetExecutionRole`:

```text
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/PantherCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Onboard Accounts

Next, real-time event consumption can be enabled by following these steps:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you have at least one AWS Account Source configured [here](aws-compliance-setup.md) with the `DeployCloudWatchEventSetup`set to`true`
{% endhint %}

1. Login to the `Administrator` account AWS Console
2. Open the [CloudFormation StackSets](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacksets) page
3. Click the `Create StackSet` button on the top right
4. Select `Template is ready`
   1. Under `Template source` select `Amazon S3 URL` and paste: `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/panther-public-cloudformation-templates/panther-cloudwatch-events/latest/template.yml`
   2. Click `Next`
5. Name the StackSet `panther-real-time-events`
   1. In the `QueueArn` field, paste the following \(substituting the AWS account ID of the account running panther\):`arn:aws:sqs:<REGION>:<MASTER_ACCOUNT_ID>:panther-aws-events-queue`
   2. Click `Next`
6. Under the Permissions tab, add the following:
   1. IAM admin role name: `PantherCloudFormationStackSetAdminRole`
   2. IAM execution role name: `PantherCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole`
   3. Click `Next`
7. Type the AWS Account IDs of the Target Accounts in the Account numbers field, separated by commas
   1. Select `Add all regions` or a list of specific regions
   2. Set `Maximum concurrent accounts` to 5
   3. Click `Next`
8. Click `Submit` at the bottom of the page to create the StackSet

To check on the status of the StackSet, check the `Operations` tab:

{% hint style="success" %}
Awesome! You should now have real-time CloudWatch events sending to Panther.
{% endhint %}

## Add Additional Accounts

To add more accounts to the StackSet above, use the following steps:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you have at least one AWS Account Source configured [here](aws-compliance-setup.md) with the `DeployCloudWatchEventSetup`set to`true`
{% endhint %}

1. Login to the `Administrator` account's AWS Console
2. On the [CloudFormation StackSets](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacksets) page, select the `panther-real-time-events` StackSet
3. Select the `Actions` button on the top right and select `Add new stacks to StackSet`
4. Add the new AWS account ID's into the Account numbers field, specify regions, and click through to the `Submit` button
