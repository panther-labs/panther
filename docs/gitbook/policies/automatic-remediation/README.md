# Automatic Remediation

## Overview

Panther supports Automatic Remediation of non-compliant resources to ensure that your infrastructure is as secure as possible. This works by:

- Associating a remediation ID with a given Policy
- When a Policy failure occurs, the `aws-remediation` Lambda assumes a role in the target account with the offending resource and performs the remediation

The following diagram shows how Panther supports Automatic Remediation:
