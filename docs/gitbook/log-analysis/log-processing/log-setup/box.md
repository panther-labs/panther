# Setup a Box App to access Box admin events from Panther

Panther has the ability to fetch events from the [Box Events API](https://developer.box.com/reference/get-events/).

In order for Panther to access the API you need to create a new 'Box App' and provide the app credentials to Panther.
Panther will use this 'Box App' and the app credentials to pull the logs periodically (every 1 minute).

{% hint style="info" %}
 To be able to read events for the entire enterprise account, the Box user performing the following steps
 *must* have [admin priviledges on the enterprise account](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/user-types/managed-users//#admin--co-admin-roles).
 Otherwise only events from the user creating the App will be accessible.
{% endhint %}
