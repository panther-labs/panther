# Supported Logs

Panther analyzes logs generated from clouds, endpoints, network devices, or applications.

All log data is parsed, analyzed, and then saved into the Panther data warehouse in your AWS account.

To request support for new log types, please open a [Github issue](https://github.com/panther-labs/panther/issues) or develop your own [with our guide](writing-parsers.md)!
