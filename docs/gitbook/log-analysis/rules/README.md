# Rules

Panther **Rules** are Python3 functions used to identify suspicious activity or generate helpful signal for your team about your environment.

## Rule Components

- A `rule` function with an `event` argument that returns `True` if the rule should send an alert, or `False` if it should not
- A `dedup` function to control how alerts are grouped together
- A `title` function to define the alert title
- Metadata containing context for triage
- An association with [specific log type(s)](log-analysis/supported-logs)

The example rule below validates if unauthenticated access occurred on an S3 bucket:

```python
def rule(event):
  if event.get('bucket') not in {'my-set-of-authenticated-buckets'}:
    return False
  return 'requester' not in event


def dedup(event):
  return event.get('bucket')


def title(event):
  return 'Unauthenticated Access to S3 Bucket  {}'.format(event.get('bucket'))
```

- This rule applies to [S3 Server Access Logs](log-analysis/log-processing/supported-logs/aws#aws-s-3-serveraccess)
- This rule groups alert events by the bucket name
- Alerts will have a title like `Unauthenticated Access to S3 Bucket my-super-secret-data`

## Workflow

Panther rules can be written, tested, and deployed either with the UI or the [panther_analysis_tool](analysis/panther-analysis-tool.md).

Each rule takes an `event` input of a given log type from the [supported logs](log-analysis/supported-logs) page.

### Rule Body

The rule body must:
* Be valid Python3
* Define a `rule()` function that accepts one argument, `event`
* Return `True` (send an alert) or `False` (known good behavior) from the rule function

```python
def rule(event):
  if event['energy_level'] > 9000:
    return True
```

The Python body may optionally:
* Import any standard Python3 libraries
* Import from the user-defined globals
* Define additional helper functions as needed
* Define variables and classes outside the scope of the rule function
* Define a `dedup(event)` function that returns a `string`
* Define a `title(event)` function that returns a `string`

Referencing the [supported logs](log-analysis/supported-logs) page provides details on all available fields in events.

#### Example Rule

Let's write a rule on a sample [NGINX Access log](../log-processing/supported-logs/Nginx.md):

```json
{
  "bodyBytesSent": 193,
  "httpReferer": "https://domain1.com/?p=1",
  "httpUserAgent": "Chrome/80.0.3987.132 Safari/537.36",
  "remoteAddr": "180.76.15.143",
  "request": "GET /admin-panel/ HTTP/1.1",
  "status": 200,
  "time": "2019-02-06 00:00:38 +0000 UTC"
}
```

This example rule would alert upon successful admin panel logins:

```python
def rule(event):
  # A common pattern is to exit the rule function early
  # to avoid unnecessary processing.
  #
  # It's also a common pattern to only proceed if requests are successful.
  if event.get('status') != 200:
    return False

  # Send an alert if a user logs into the admin panel.
  return 'admin-panel' in event.get('request')
```

In the `rule()` body, returning a value of `True` indicates an alert should send. Returning a value of `False` indicates the log is not suspicious.

{% hint style="info" %}
When accessing non-required event fields, it's recommended to use `.get()`.
{% endhint %}

### Alert Deduplication

To avoid alert fatigue, events are grouped together (by a deduplication string), within a given time period (deduplication period), and associated with a single `AlertID`.

By default, events are merged on the key `defaultDedupString:${RuleID}` over a period of `1h`. These options are fully configurable!

The `dedupPeriodMinutes` may be set to either:
* `15m`
* `30m`
* `1h`
* `3h`
* `12h`
* `24h`

To modify the deduplication key, use the `dedup()` function in your rule body:

```python
def dedup(event):
  return event.get('remoteAddr')
```

{% hint style="warn" %}
The returned `dedup` string is limited to `1000` characters and will be truncated.
{% endhint %}

The same parsed log `event` is passed into this function, and you may use any logic desired to calculate the `dedupString`.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a Falsy value is returned from `dedup()`, then the default string will be used.
{% endhint %}

### Alert Titles

Alert titles sent to our destinations are the default value of `New Alert: ${Display Name or ID}`. To override this message, use the `title()` function in your rule:

```python
def title(event):
  return 'Admin Panel Login'
```

The title can also be interpolated by using event attributes:

```python
def title(event):
  return 'Successful Admin Panel Login from IP {}'.format(
    event.get('remoteAddr', '<IP_NOT_FOUND>'))
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The second argument to `.get()` is the default value returned if the key is not found. By supplying a value here, we avoid a title of 'Successful Admin Panel Login from IP None'
{% endhint %}

## First Steps with Rules

When beginning your rule writing/editing journey, your team should decide between a UI or CLI driven workflow.

Then, configure the built in rules by searching for the `Configuration Required` tag. These rules are designed to be modified by you, the security professional, based on your organization's internal business logic.

## Writing Rules with the Panther Analysis Tool

The [panther_analysis_tool](panther-analysis-tool.md) is a Python command line interface for testing, packaging, and deploying Panther Policies and Rules. This enables teams to work in a more developer oriented workflow and track detections with version control systems such as `git`.

To learn more about this workflow, check out the guide [here](analysis/panther-analysis-tool.md).
