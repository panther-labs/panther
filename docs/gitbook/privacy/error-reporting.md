# Background

The Panther team greatly benefits from knowing runtime issues that occur in Panther installations,
since it enables us to identify and resolve them quickly.

If you opt in to error reporting, the following information will be sent to the Panther team
everytime there is a web application exception or crash:

- The version of your Browser, OS & Panther installation
  > This helps us know how to properly replicate the issue.
- The type of error, its related stack trace and the URL of the page in which it occurred.
  > This helps us identify the piece of code associated with the issue you are experiencing, while gaining insight on the preceding function calls. **All sensitive parameters or variables are excluded**.

You can always change your error reporting preference through the **General Settings** page
