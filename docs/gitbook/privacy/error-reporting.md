# Background

The Panther team greatly benefits from knowing runtime issues that occur in Panther installations,
since it enables it to identify them and resolve them quickly.

Opting in or out of it is your choice, which you can always modify through your organization's
**General Settings** page. If you opt in, the following information will be sent to the Panther team
everytime there is a web application exception or crash:

- Your Public IPv4
  > This helps us identify whether the same or a different user is experiencing the error. This information is not used in any other way.
- The version of your Browser, OS & Panther installation
  > This helps us know how to properly replicate the issue
- The URL of the page in which the error occurred, as well as the source file associated with it.
  > This helps us identify the piece of code associated with the issue you are experiencing
