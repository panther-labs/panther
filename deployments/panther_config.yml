##### Panther deployment configuration #####

Infra:
  # Comma-delimited list of LayerVersions to attach to every Lambda function.
  #
  # For example, this could be a serverless monitoring/security service.
  BaseLayerVersionArns: ''

  # Allow HTTP(S) ingress access to the web app (ALB) security group from this IP block.
  # Use 0.0.0.0/0 to allow unrestricted access
  LoadBalancerSecurityGroupCidr: 0.0.0.0/0

  # These optional settings will allow you to deploy the panther load balancer into a security group
  # And VPC of your choice. If you set VpcID, you must also set SecurityGroupID and ensure the
  # subnet IP ranges are valid & available.
  VpcID: ''
  # These values only take affect if VpcID is specified
  SecurityGroupID: ''
  SubnetOneIPRange: '172.31.250.0/26' # By default, this IP range should be available in the default VPC
  SubnetTwoIPRange: '172.31.251.0/26' # By default, this IP range should be available in the default VPC

  # Lambda functions scale memory and CPU together.
  # Those with the smallest memory are slower and cheaper.
  # Those with the larger memory are faster and more expensive.
  # If cost is more of a concern compared to performance, choose
  # a small memory size, however, for extremely large log volumes
  # the larger sizes may be required for adequate performance or large files.
  # Processing capability can be further increased by raising the
  # Lambda concurrent execution limit from default 1000, see:
  # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html
  LogProcessorLambdaMemorySize: 2048 # 256 - 3008, in 64MB increments

  # Create a Python layer with these pip library versions for analysis and remediation.
  #
  # "mage deploy" will download and package these libraries, generating the "out/layer.zip" file.
  # Natively compiled libraries (e.g. numpy) must be deployed from linux to work correctly, or
  # you can provide your own custom layer via PythonLayerVersionArn.
  #
  # Be sure to remove "out/layer.zip" or run "mage clean" to force a new build of the layer if you
  # change this setting.
  #
  # This setting has no effect if PythonLayerVersionArn is set below.
  #
  # Contributors, take note: the default layer (packaged with Panther releases) bundled in the
  # bootstrap-gateway stack must fit within the ~50MB SAR package limit. boto3, for example, is too big

  # If not specified, a layer is created for you based on the PipLayer setting above.

Monitoring:
  # This is the arn for the SNS topic you want associated with Panther system alarms.
  # If this is not set alarms will be associated with the SNS topic `panther-alarms`.

  # List of policy/rule sets to install when Panther is first deployed.

  # Enable S3 access logs for Panther buckets.
  # Doing so is a strongly recommend security practice, but can come at a high cost
  # when processing large volumes of data.
