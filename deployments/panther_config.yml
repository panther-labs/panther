##### Panther deployment configuration #####

# CloudFormation parameters for the monitoring.yml which deploys the monitoring stack.
MonitoringParameterValues:
  # This is the arn for the SNS topic you want associated with Panther system alarms.
  # If this is not set alarms will be associated with the SNS topic `panther-alarms`.

# CloudFormation parameter overrides for the core/buckets.yml prerequisite stack.
BucketsParameterValues:
  # Use an existing S3 bucket for storing access logs. If not specified, one is created for you.

  # Custom layer attached to every Python Lambda function for analysis and remediation.
  #
  # If not specified, a layer is created for you based on the PipLayer setting below.

# Create a Python layer with these pip library versions.
#
# This makes it easy to add your own pip libraries for analysis and remediation.
# Natively compiled libraries (e.g. numpy) are not currently supported: build a custom layer instead.

# Entries can be URLs or file:// paths that point to a .zip file.
# If the analysis-api is non-empty, this setting is ignored and you can instead
# use the BulkUpload functionality from the web app to upload new or modified rule sets.
