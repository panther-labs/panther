##### Panther deployment configuration #####

# CloudFormation parameters for the monitoring.yml which deploys the monitoring stack.
MonitoringParameterValues:
  # This is the arn for the SNS topic you want associated with Panther system alarms.
  # If this is not set alarms will be associated with the SNS topic `panther-alarms`.
  AlarmSNSTopicARN: ''

# CloudFormation parameter overrides for the core/buckets.yml prerequisite stack.
BucketsParameterValues:
  # Use an existing S3 bucket for storing access logs. If not specified, one is created for you.
  S3AccessLogsBucket: ''

# CloudFormation parameters for controlling how Panther monitors this account (itself)
OnboardingParameterValues:
  # Whether or not the Panther deployment should automatically onboard itself as a data source.
  OnboardSelf: true
  # Whether or not to create a CloudTrail in the Panther account and monitor.
  # You may want this off if you have org-level CT configured for Panther to avoid ingesting the same data twice.
  EnableCloudTrail: true
  # Whether or not to enable GuardDuty in the Panther account and monitor.
  # You may want this off if you have org-level GD configured for Panther.
  EnableGuardDuty: true

# CloudFormation parameter overrides for the backend.yml which deploys the backend stack.
BackendParameterValues:
  # Log processor lambda size
  #
  # Lambda functions scale memory and CPU together.
  # Those with the smallest memory are slower and cheaper.
  # Those with the larger memory are faster and more expensive.
  # If cost is more of a concern compared to performance, choose
  # a small memory size, however, for extremely large log volumes
  # the larger sizes may be required for adequate performance or large files.
  # Lambda size can be allocated from 128MB to 3008MB, in 64MB increments.
  # For the log processor lambda we set a minimum size of 256.
  #
  LogProcessorLambdaMemorySize: 1024

  # Retention period for all Panther CloudWatch log groups.
  CloudWatchLogRetentionDays: 365

  # Enable DEBUG logging for all Lambda functions.
  Debug: false

  # Comma-delimited list of LayerVersions to attach to every Lambda function.
  #
  # For example, this could be a serverless monitoring/security service.
  LayerVersionArns: ''

  # Custom layer attached to every Python Lambda function for analysis and remediation.
  #
  # If not specified, a layer is created for you based on the PipLayer setting below.
  PythonLayerVersionArn: ''

  # ARN of an AWS ACM certificate used on the loadbalancer presenting the panther web app
  #
  # If not specified, a self signed certificate is created automatically.
  # WARNING: SELF SIGNED CERTIFICATES ARE NOT SAFE TO USE IN PRODUCTION, PLEASE
  # PROVIDE A CERTIFICATE FOR PRODUCTION USE
  WebApplicationCertificateArn: ''

  # Domain that you own and have configured to alias to the default load balancer URL
  #
  # If not specified, the default load balancer URL is used in all places.
  CustomDomain: ''

  # XRay tracing mode for API Gateway and Lambda: '', 'Active', or 'PassThrough'
  TracingMode: ''

FrontendParameterValues:
  # The size of the CPU allocated to the front-end web server.
  # Allowed values: [256, 512, 1024]
  #
  # For example, a value of 1024 equals to 1 vCPU, while a value of 256 equals to 0.25 vCPU
  WebApplicationFargateTaskCPU: 512

  # The size of memory (in MB) allocated to the front-end web server
  # Allowed values: [512, 1024, 2056]
  #
  # For example, a value of 1024 means 1GB of RAM memory
  WebApplicationFargateTaskMemory: 1024

# Create a Python layer with these pip library versions.
#
# This makes it easy to add your own pip libraries for analysis and remediation.
# Natively compiled libraries (e.g. numpy) are not currently supported: build a custom layer instead.
#
# This setting has no effect if PythonLayerVersionArn is set above.
PipLayer:
  - boto3==1.11.16
  - policyuniverse==1.3.2.1
  - requests==2.22.0

# List of policy/rule sets to install when Panther is FIRST deployed.
#
# Entries can be URLs or file:// paths that point to a .zip file.
# If the analysis-api is non-empty, this setting is ignored and you can instead
# use the BulkUpload functionality from the web app to upload new or modified rule sets.
