## About Us

We are a San Francisco based [startup](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/panther-labs) comprising security engineers who have spent years building large-scale detection and response for companies including Airbnb, Amazon, Riverbed, and more. Panther was founded by the core architect of [StreamAlert](https://github.com/airbnb/streamalert/), a cloud-native solution for automated log analysis open-sourced by Airbnb.

Panther is the next step for security teams who need a modern alternative to traditional SIEMs. We designed Panther for massive scale, with a rich and intuitive user experience, in-browser Python rule editing, and first-class AWS support.

Our mission is to provide an open platform to effectively protect businesses from cybersecurity threats.

## Use cases

Panther analyzes all security data generated by your clouds, networks, applications, and hosts to power threat detection, compliance, and security investigations. Panther provides flexible detection logic, a secure deployment within your AWS cloud, support for common security tools, and automation for painless deployments. Common uses include:

- **Detect Unauthorized Access:** Analyze logs to identify unauthorized access into systems
- **Threat Hunting:** Quickly search logs for matches against indicators of compromise with Panther's standardized data fields
- **Achieve Compliance:** Use [built-in detections](https://github.com/panther-labs/panther-analysis) as controls for SOC/PCI/HIPAA compliance
- **Secure Your Cloud Resources:** Automatically fix misconfigurations that could cause severe damage if exploited

_NOTE: Panther is currently in beta._

## Deployment

Follow our [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.runpanther.io/quick-start) to deploy Panther to your AWS account in a matter of minutes!
